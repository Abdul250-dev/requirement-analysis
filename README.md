# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
This repository is created to collect, organize, and document the system requirements for an Airbnb booking platform. It serves as the foundational step in planning and designing the system's architecture.

# What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a foundational phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) where developers, analysts, and stakeholders gather, evaluate, and document the needs and expectations of end-users for a software system. The goal is to clearly define what the system should do, how it should behave, and what constraints it must operate within â€” all before actual development begins.

Key Activities Involved:

- Eliciting requirements from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, or observation
- Analyzing and resolving any ambiguities, conflicts, or overlaps
- Documenting functional and non-functional requirements
- Validating and prioritizing requirements for feasibility and importance

# Why is Requirement Analysis Important? 

Requirement Analysis is one of the most essential phases in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). It sets the direction for the entire project and helps ensure the final product aligns with user needs and business goals.

1. ðŸŽ¯ Clarifies Project Scope and Objectives
Requirement analysis helps all stakeholdersâ€”clients, users, and developersâ€”reach a shared understanding of what the system should do. This reduces confusion, ensures everyone is aligned, and prevents scope creep (the uncontrolled expansion of project goals).

2. ðŸ’¸ Minimizes Costly Rework
Identifying and addressing requirements early in the SDLC is much cheaper and more efficient than making changes later during development or after deployment. Requirement analysis helps detect gaps, conflicts, or unrealistic expectations early on.

3. ðŸ“Š Guides Design, Development, and Testing
Requirements serve as the foundation for system design, architecture, and testing plans. Clear and well-documented requirements ensure that developers build the right functionality and testers can validate it against the agreed criteria.
