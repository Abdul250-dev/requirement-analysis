# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
This repository is created to collect, organize, and document the system requirements for an Airbnb booking platform. It serves as the foundational step in planning and designing the system's architecture.

# What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a foundational phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) where developers, analysts, and stakeholders gather, evaluate, and document the needs and expectations of end-users for a software system. The goal is to clearly define what the system should do, how it should behave, and what constraints it must operate within â€” all before actual development begins.

# Why is Requirement Analysis Important? 

Requirement Analysis is one of the most essential phases in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). It sets the direction for the entire project and helps ensure the final product aligns with user needs and business goals.

1. ðŸŽ¯ Clarifies Project Scope and Objectives
Requirement analysis helps all stakeholdersâ€”clients, users, and developersâ€”reach a shared understanding of what the system should do. This reduces confusion, ensures everyone is aligned, and prevents scope creep (the uncontrolled expansion of project goals).

2. ðŸ’¸ Minimizes Costly Rework
Identifying and addressing requirements early in the SDLC is much cheaper and more efficient than making changes later during development or after deployment. Requirement analysis helps detect gaps, conflicts, or unrealistic expectations early on.

3. ðŸ“Š Guides Design, Development, and Testing
Requirements serve as the foundation for system design, architecture, and testing plans. Clear and well-documented requirements ensure that developers build the right functionality and testers can validate it against the agreed criteria.

# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.

Requirement Analysis involves several interconnected activities that ensure software requirements are complete, clear, and actionable. Below are the five key activities in this process:

ðŸ”¹ 1. Requirement Gathering
- Involves collecting initial information about the systemâ€™s purpose, target users, and business goals.
- Stakeholders such as clients, users, developers, and project managers are identified and engaged.
- Methods include reviewing existing documentation, conducting feasibility studies, and understanding current systems (if applicable).

ðŸ”¹ 2. Requirement Elicitation
- Focuses on actively extracting detailed requirements from stakeholders through interactive techniques.
- Techniques include interviews, surveys, brainstorming sessions, focus groups, workshops, and observation.
- The aim is to uncover both explicit needs and implicit expectations that may not be clearly stated.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Requirement Documentation
- Translates gathered and elicited information into a structured format that can be easily reviewed and shared.
- Includes the creation of Software Requirement Specifications (SRS), user stories, or use case diagrams.
- Ensures that requirements are recorded accurately, unambiguously, and traceably for future reference.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling
- Involves refining, categorizing, and prioritizing requirements for technical feasibility and business alignment.
- Identifies inconsistencies, duplicates, or conflicts among the requirements.
- May include visual modeling using tools like flowcharts, entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs), data flow diagrams (DFDs), or UML.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Requirement Validation
- Ensures that documented requirements are correct, complete, and meet stakeholder expectations.
- Techniques include review meetings, walkthroughs, prototyping, and formal approval from stakeholders.
- Prevents misunderstandings that could lead to project delays or product failures.

ðŸ“Ž Together, these five activities ensure that the software is designed to meet real needs, reducing the risk of rework, cost overruns, and user dissatisfaction.
