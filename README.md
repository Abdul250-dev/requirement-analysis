# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
This repository is created to collect, organize, and document the system requirements for an Airbnb booking platform. It serves as the foundational step in planning and designing the architecture of the system.

#  What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a foundational phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) where developers, analysts, and stakeholders gather, evaluate, and document the needs and expectations of end-users for a software system. The goal is to clearly define what the system should do, how it should behave, and what constraints it must operate within â€” all before actual development begins.

Key Activities Involved:

- Eliciting requirements from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, or observation
- Analyzing and resolving any ambiguities, conflicts, or overlaps
- Documenting functional and non-functional requirements
- Validating and prioritizing requirements for feasibility and importance
